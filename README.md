<h1>🧹 Data 1- Cleaning in Pandas </h1>

This project is the first in a series on Data & AI. It serves as an in-depth introduction to data cleaning using Python and pandas. The project showcases practical examples of real-world data cleaning techniques on customer information to prepare it for subsequent data analysis and AI tasks.

<h1>🔍 Project Overview</h1>

The notebook covers a variety of data cleaning techniques:

    📄 Data Loading: Reading data from an Excel file into a pandas DataFrame.
    🔎 Data Exploration: Inspecting data for inconsistencies, missing values, and formatting issues.
    🧼 Data Cleaning: Removing unwanted columns, handling missing values, and standardizing data formats.
    🔧 Data Transformation: Reformatting data for consistency and further analysis.
    ✅ Data Verification: Validating the transformations to ensure data quality.

<h1>🌟 Features </h1>

    Scalable: The approach can be adapted to datasets of varying sizes and structures.
    Reproducible: The code is structured for easy re-use and extension.
    Integration-Friendly: Compatible with different data sources, making it ideal for integration with other data processing pipelines.
