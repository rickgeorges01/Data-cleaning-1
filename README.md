<h1> 🧹 Data Cleaning Project 1 : Customer service </h1>

Welcome to the Data Cleaning Project! This project aims to clean and prepare data efficiently using pandas within a Jupyter Notebook environment. Data cleaning is essential for improving data quality and usability before analysis or visualization.
<h2>🔧 Prerequisites </h2>
  Make sure you have the following tools and libraries installed:
      
    🐍 Python 3.x
    📓 Jupyter Notebook
    🐼 pandas
    📊 openpyxl (to read Excel files)
    

  You can install the dependencies using pip:
    ``pip install pandas openpyxl jupyter``
    
<h2>📂 Project Contents </h2>
    Reading Data: Load data from an Excel file using pandas.
    Data Cleaning: Clean and transform data using techniques such as:
        
        ❌ Removing duplicates
        🧹 Replacing missing values (NaN)
        🔄 String transformations (dates, numbers, etc.)
        🛠 Extracting relevant information from complex columns
        📏 Normalizing values in specific columns

<h2>🚀 How to Use</h2>

    Clone or download this project to your local machine.
    Open the ``.ipynb`` file in Jupyter Notebook.
    Follow the code cells to clean the data.
    Modify the code as needed to tailor the cleaning process to your data.
    
<h2>🌟 Results </h2>
    After completing this project, the data should be clean, consistent, and ready for further analysis or modeling.
